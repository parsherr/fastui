description: How to install dependencies and use the library
---

## Requirements

Use **Node.js 18** or later and install dependencies with pnpm. A `.nvmrc` file is included to match the expected Node version, and the install script checks that you have pnpm **9.15.3** or newer. If Node 18 isn’t installed, run `nvm install` and then `nvm use`.

Installation works just like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/). Here's how to get started:

<Steps>

### Create project

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project or set up an existing one:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

### Add fastui components

Copy the template components from the `fastui` library into your project, or create your own inside the `components/ui` folder.

You can now import and use any template component:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Button>Click me</Button>
      <h1>Window size</h1>
      <p>Width: {width}</p>
      <p>Height: {height}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
